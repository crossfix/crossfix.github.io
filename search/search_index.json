CrossFix uses a two-phase approach. In the first phase, given an open GitHub issue, CrossFix automatically extracts information from it to build a query q online to search for closed GitHub issues with similar exception information, condition that triggers the bug, or general description that summarize the bug extracted from its title. In the second phase, CrossFix goes through the search results for q online and re-rank the list of GitHub issues n 1 , n 2 , ..., n i . For each issue n i , CrossFix computes the quality of n i , and the similarity between the open issue and n i based on multiple analyses. The final output of CrossFix is a ranked list of GitHub issues. We consider only the top-1 GitHub issue as the best navigator issue that will be used as similar bug .
